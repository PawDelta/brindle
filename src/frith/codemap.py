"""A code map for agents: the repo's graphify knowledge graph, if it has one.

Finding the code a task touches is much of what an agent spends tokens on:
listing folders, grepping, reading whole files to find one function.
``graphify query "<question>"`` answers from a prebuilt graph of the repo
instead, listing the relevant symbols with file and line, in well under a
second. When the repo has ``graphify-out/graph.json`` and graphify is
installed, frith tells its agents to ask the graph first and read only what
it points to.

Workers query the graph of the main checkout (their own worktree doesn't
have ``graphify-out/``, which is usually ignored); its paths are relative to
the repo, so they hold in any worktree. After each merge frith refreshes the
graph in the background with ``graphify update``, which re-extracts code
without an LLM, so the next workers see the merged code.

``graphify`` in ``.frith/config.json``: true or false to force it on or off;
unset, it's on whenever the graph and the command are there.
