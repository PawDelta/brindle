"""Delivering messages through Claude Code's own inbox.

Every Claude Code session listens on a Unix socket for messages from other
sessions, and tells its child processes where it is (``CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET``
and ``CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN``). frith's hooks are such children, so the
SessionStart hook records the socket for the agent, and from then on frith
sends messages to it there instead of typing them into the agent's pane.

What that changes: a message no longer waits for the agent to go idle. An
idle agent starts a new turn with it; a busy one gets it between tool calls
and acts on it once the current step is done. And nothing depends on
reading the screen to know when typing is safe.

The wire format (a JSON line each): an auth frame, then the message::

    {"type": "auth", "token": "<token>"}
    {"type": "user", "message": {"content": "<text>"}, "from": "frith",
     "priority": "next", "uuid": "<uuid>"}

Claude Code presents the text as a message from a peer named ``from``. It
respects the session's ``crossSessionInbound`` setting: ``accept`` (the
default) delivers, ``hold`` asks the person first, ``refuse`` drops. Typing
into the pane remains the fallback whenever the socket isn't there.
