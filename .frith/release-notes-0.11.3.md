frith 0.11.3 stops the pipeline from merging into your default branch on its own, lets a supervisor run on (or hand over to) another branch, and makes chat text easy to copy.

## Changed
- **No automatic merges into the default branch.** When a reviewed branch's base is the repo's default branch (usually `main`), the pipeline now sends the supervisor a "needs you" message instead of merging; `merge_workspace` merges it. Set `"merge_into"` to an integration branch in `.frith/config.json` to have workers branch from and merge into it, or `"auto_merge_default_branch": true` for the old behaviour. (#8)

## Added
- **`frith start -b BRANCH` / `-w PATH`** runs the supervisor in that branch's worktree, creating it if needed. A linked worktree finds the repo's `.frith` config through the main checkout. (#9)
- **`frith handover --to BRANCH|PATH`** (and a `handover` tool for supervisors) moves the goal, milestones, workers, queued tasks and a note to a new supervisor there. (#10)
- **`list_agents` shows each worker's last tool call and how long ago it was active.** (#11)
- **Copying chat text:** dragging selects within the chat pane and copies to the clipboard (`pbcopy`, `wl-copy` or `xclip`); `h` in the sidebar or `prefix S` hides the sidebar; `"sidebar": "bottom"` puts the dashboard under the chat. (#12)

## Fixed
- **The pipeline no longer kills its own reviewer while cleaning up after a merge,** which could leave a half-removed worktree, a stale status and no "merged" message. (#6)
- **`workspace_diff(stat_only=true)` is bounded:** untracked files are summarized per directory, `.venv`/`node_modules` and the like are collapsed, and long listings are cut off. (#7)
